This package aims to bring jetpack compose style modifiers into the flutter world.

## Features

When working with Jetpack compose, you will realize that they chose a different approach for applying
"properties" to widgets.
Most widgets can be equipped with a modifier, which can be used to apply padding, coloring, animations etc.
This reduces indentations withing the widget tree, promotes extendability and separation of concerns.
This package tries to bring this concept into flutter.

```dart
